# Design tooling (UI/UX), and the keys it needs


`.claude/skills/` vendors the MIT-licensed
[ui-ux-pro-max](https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill) suite,
installed with `npx ui-ux-pro-max-cli init --ai claude`. It is unrelated to the
trading library — the package itself is headless — and exists only so sessions in
this repo can build dashboards, docs pages, and report UIs to a consistent
standard. Nothing under `pwb_toolbox/` imports it, and `pytest` never touches it.

The core skill is a local CSV database (84 UI styles, 192 color palettes, 74 font
pairings, 98 UX guidelines, 25 chart types, 22 stacks) queried with stdlib Python
— no network, no API key:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "saas landing page" --domain style
python3 .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "fintech dashboard" --domain color --json
```

The SKILL.md frontmatter says "67 styles, 161 palettes" — that string is hardcoded
in the upstream template and lags the shipped CSVs. Trust the data files.

`docs/index.html` is a landing page built entirely from those queries — palette,
font pairing and motion timings all came from the skill rather than being invented.
It is a single self-contained file: both typefaces are embedded as base64 woff2, so
it opens from `file://` with no build step and no network, which is also why it is
~120 KB. Rebuilding means re-querying the skill, not editing the base64 by hand.

`docs/` is published straight from the branch — **Settings → Pages → Source →
"Deploy from a branch"**, branch `main`, folder `/docs`. GitHub builds and serves it
itself; no workflow is involved, and the build shows up in Actions as a
`pages build and deployment` run that nothing in this repo authors.

That is what makes `docs/.nojekyll` load-bearing rather than decorative. The branch
source runs the folder through Jekyll, which would otherwise try to build the `.md`
files sitting beside `index.html`. The file is empty — its presence is the entire
signal.

There used to be a `.github/workflows/pages.yml` that deployed the same directory
through `actions/deploy-pages`. It never once succeeded, and it was removed rather
than left to add a red X to every push touching `docs/`. Two reasons, either
sufficient: a workflow cannot enable Pages here in the first place, because the
default `GITHUB_TOKEN` may not create a Pages site (`Create Pages site failed.
Error: Resource not accessible by integration` — `pages: write` covers deploying to
a site that already exists, not creating one); and once a branch source is selected,
`actions/deploy-pages` cannot target it at all, since it only deploys to sites whose
build type is `workflow`. Reviving it would mean switching Source back to "GitHub
Actions" and enabling Pages by hand first.

The installer also drops six companion skills (`design`, `design-system`,
`ui-styling`, `brand`, `slides`, `banner-design`) alongside the main one. They were
removed deliberately — several of their generators shell out to `npx shadcn` or
image APIs and none were needed here. Re-running `uipro init` restores them, so
prune again after any upgrade.

`.mcp.json` registers 21st.dev's [21st MCP](https://21st.dev/mcp) (the successor to
Magic MCP) for generating React/Tailwind components. It is an HTTP server
authenticated with `${API_KEY_21ST}` — never hardcode the key in `.mcp.json`.

Claude Code expands `${...}` from its own process environment and does not read
`.env`, so how you supply the key depends on where the session runs.

**Local sessions** — export it before launching, from your shell profile or with
`set -a; . .env; set +a`:

```bash
export API_KEY_21ST=...   # https://21st.dev/settings/api-keys
```

**Claude Code on the web** — there is no shell profile to export from, so the key
goes in the cloud environment's **Environment variables** field, in the environment
dialog at claude.ai/code (opened with the cloud icon; personal environments have no
separate page in account settings). The field takes `.env` format, one `KEY=value`
per line:

```text
API_KEY_21ST=...
```

Sessions copy those values into their process environment once at startup, which is
what `${API_KEY_21ST}` then expands from. Editing the field only affects sessions
started afterward — a running session keeps the values it booted with, so start a
new one rather than expecting a live pickup.

Two things bite on the web beyond the variable itself:

- **Network access.** The server dials `https://21st.dev/api/mcp` from the session's
  own network. The default **Trusted** level allows package registries, GitHub, and
  cloud SDKs — not 21st.dev — so the environment needs **Custom** access with
  `21st.dev` in **Allowed domains**, and "Also include default list of common package
  managers" ticked to keep the Trusted set. The exemption that lets MCP *connectors*
  skip the allowlist does not apply here: it covers claude.ai connectors routed
  through Anthropic's servers, not a project `.mcp.json` server.
- **Visibility.** Cloud environments have no secrets store, and Anthropic's docs
  advise against putting API keys in environment variables at all — anyone who uses
  the environment can read them, and an org-shared environment exposes them to every
  member. A scoped 21st.dev key is a low-stakes thing to accept that for, but treat
  it as a deliberate trade: keep it in a personal environment, not a shared one, and
  rotate it at https://21st.dev/settings/api-keys if it leaks.

Without the variable the server fails to authenticate; nothing else in the repo
is affected. Note that `21st` authenticates by header, not OAuth — picking it from
the `/mcp` menu and signing in through a browser will not fix a missing key.

## Credentials

`load_dataset` reads `PWB_API_KEY`, falling back to the Hugging Face Hub and
then to yfinance. Never commit keys; `.env` is gitignored.

`API_KEY_21ST` (21st.dev, from https://21st.dev/settings/api-keys) is read from the
environment by `.mcp.json`. Never commit keys; `.env` is gitignored.

`.env.example` lists both variables. Copy it to `.env` and fill it in — but note
that `.env` alone does not reach `.mcp.json`, which reads the process environment.
Locally that means exporting the key; on the web it means setting it in the cloud
environment's variables. Both routes, and the network and visibility caveats that
come with the web one, are under "Design tooling (UI/UX)" above.
